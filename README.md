# discrete-math-calculator

<h3> Preface </h3>
This program was created to assist myself in solving and verifying math problems concerning a Discrete Mathematics course.
The program will be a windows executable .exe file written using C++ and will be available to users with windows systems.

Currently the inital function of the program is to calculate the number of integers between and two integer values m and n.
The use is specific but will be expanded to solve more complex problems as my need dictates or if users request the functionality.

<h3> Introduction </h3>
Solving formulas by hand can be quite time consuming. The intention of this program is to save time by solving otherwise tedious questions or evaluations quickly.

<h3> Glossary </h3>
Integer - Commonly refered to as the counting numbers ( -inf, ... , -3 , -2, -1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , &infin )
